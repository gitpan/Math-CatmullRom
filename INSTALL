Like most Lazy perl programmers I use MakeMaker, so try:

bash$ perl Makefile.PL
bash$ make
bash$ make test
bash$ make install

And if you have trouble then e-mail me.

This is a pure-perl implementation of Catmull-Rom splines.

Catmull-Rom splines are much like Bezier curves except the curve they plot
is guaranteed to pass through the control points rather than just be
attracted by them.
